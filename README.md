# The Digital Field

The following project is called The Digital Field. The work investigates a process that utilizes the orientation and resolution of digital space in architectural design.

3D software has enabled designers to visualize space while designing. This mode of representation has led to one understanding of space as a grid of voxels, or 3-Dimensional pixels. The Digital Field seeks to prioritize space in the design process by considering properties of digital space as functions of design. Orientation, the direction of the voxel grid relative to the cardinal points, affects the array of voxels in relation to site and context. Resolution relates to the density of the grid, and will affect the detail at which form and space can be aggregated. Spatial primitives based upon a series of parameters were designed to create an architectural program. The form is realized with a simple, repetitive formal element, akin to a digital lego, that aggregates around the spaces. 

The simple choice of orientation and resolution create a cascade of affects on the design. The formal voxel block subordinates the formal whole to an expression of space. The work represents an approach to architectural design enable by digital media. The proposal is for a genuine architecture of space. 

## The Aspects of Space in Architectural Design

A Rhino software plugin (RHI) was developed for the project. It is written in Python and includes a series of modules that are called through a main script. The plugin operates by allowing users to first choose the resolution of the voxel-grid as well as its orientation. A series of rules then dictates the distribution and configuration of spatial primitives throughout the grid. The newly developed spaces combine with any existing constraints for form. Finally, the voxel-block form aggregates around the spaces to define the architecture.
